# Lemmy Instance Assistant

Say that you have an account on "https://lemmy.ca".

After looking for a community on Google, you may end up on an instance that is different from your own (ex. "https://lemmy.ml/c/technology"). If you want to subscribe to the community, you need to copy the code (ex. `!technology@lemmy.ml`), open your own instance, and then paste it into the search page.

This extension will redirect that link to the version on your instance (ex. "https://lemmy.ca/c/technology@lemmy.ml"), allowing you to subscribe or participate immediately
