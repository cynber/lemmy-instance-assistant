# What is this?

Say that you have an account on "https://lemmy.ca".

After looking for a community on Google, you may end up on a Lemmy or Kbin instance that is different from your own (https://lemmy.ml/c/technology). If you want to subscribe to the community, you need to copy the code (`!technology@lemmy.ml`), open your home instance, and then paste it into the search page.

This extension will redirect that link to the version on your home instance (ex. "https://lemmy.ca/c/technology@lemmy.ml"), allowing you to subscribe and participate immediately.

* **Opera:** Version 1.2.1 is currently under review. Once that is approved, I will upload the most recent version.

#### When will it be on **Safari**?:
* There are tools available to port the extension over to Safari. Unfortunately, I currently don't have a recent MacOS device to sign the extension. I'm still looking in to this, but in the meantime if you would like to contribute, please let me know!

#### When will it be on **______** browser?
* Currently there aren't any plans to add it to any other browsers. Most other browsers should be able to download the extension from one of the stores above. I'm open to feedback, and you can contribute to the discussion here: <a href="https://lemmy.ca/c/instance_assistant">https://lemmy.ca/c/instance_assistant</a>

# SETUP

Set your home instance:
1. Click on the extension icon on your toolbar (top right)
2. Click "Change my home instance" and type in the URL of your home instance (ex. "https://lemmy.ca"). To make things easier, you can click on the buttons to quickly copy the URL of some common home instances.   

**RECOMMENDED** - Allow access to all sites:
1. Right click on the extension icon
2. Click on "Manage Extension"
3. On the new page that opens, go to "Permissions"
4. Click the toggle on "Access your data for all websites"

> EXPLANATION: In order to see a button on the community you are using, you will need to allow the extension to access that site. However, since a lemmy instance can have any URL, you will need to keep doing this for any new instance you come across. Flipping this toggle will let you skip this annoyance. The extension is not collecting any data and everything is running locally so there shouldn't be a risk from enabling this. However if you don't want to enable this, you can also use the button in the extension itself as it should always work regardless.

<br/> 

# Usage
Once your home instance is set, you can redirect to it using one of two methods:
* Button in popup: Click on the extension, and then click "Open this community in my instance". This is the recommended method.
* Button on site: If the extension has access to an instance, it should load a button directly in the sidebar. You may need to reload the page in order to see it.
  * To give the extension access, either use the setup method above, or right click on the extension and click "Always allow on ____"
